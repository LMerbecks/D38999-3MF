# D38999-3MF
In this repository we develop a MIL-DTL-38999 connector (system) that can be 3D-printed. It was inspired by [this thing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3129731) by [fdavies](https://www.thingiverse.com/fdavies/designs)

## Introduction

MIL-DTL-38999 connectors are widely adopted in the aerospace industry. You may take a look at the different variants at leading manufacturers like [Amphenol Aerospace](https://www.amphenol-aerospace.com/products/mil-dtl-38999-connectors) or [ITT Cannon](https://www.ittcannon.com/38999-style). A really common type is the type III variant.

These connectors are durable, [scoop-proof](https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/scoop-proof-connectors) and satisfying to work with. However, they are also very expensive and thus not an option for hobbyist projects. This project aims to change that by making these connectors accessible to a general public via additive manufacturing. Surely these versions will never match the characteristics of the industrial versions but makes the D38999 accessible to more people than just a small industry branch. 

The final goal is to create a connector system that can be 3D printed with minmal effort, uses cheap and commonly available electrical contacts, and is modular. 

## Road map

The first step in this project will be to generate 3D models for the series III connectors. All further tasks to reach this goal are tracked in this projects issues.
